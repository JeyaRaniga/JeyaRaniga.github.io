    <h2>Personality Exploration</h2>
    <p>I've always found that I have never really fit into a category of intraversion or extraversion, I was never satisfied with the ENTJ personality Myers-Briggs described me as. Most of us find it difficult to choose between introversion and extraversion because the introvert/extrovert dichotomy reflects a tired and outdated view of personality. Personality traits exist along a continuum, and the vast majority of us fall somewhere in the middle.
    <br>
    Ambiverts have a distinct advantage over true introverts and extroverts. Because their personality doesn’t lean too heavily in either direction, they have a much easier time adjusting their approach to people based on the situation. This enables them to connect more easily, and more deeply, with a wider variety of people. Ambiverts naturally engage in a flexible pattern of talking and listening, ambiverts are likely to express sufficient assertiveness and enthusiasm to persuade and close a deal, but are more inclined to listen to customers’ interests and less vulnerable to appearing too excited or overconfident.</p>

    <h3>How Ambiversion Works In The Brain</h3>
    <p>How social you are is largely driven by dopamine, the brain’s feel-good hormone. We all have different levels of dopamine-fueled stimulation in the neocortex (the area of the brain that is responsible for higher mental functions such as language and conscious thought). Those who naturally have high levels of stimulation tend to be introverts—they try and avoid any extra social stimulation that might make them feel anxious or overwhelmed. Those with low levels of stimulation tend to be extroverts. Under-stimulation leaves extroverts feeling bored, so they seek social stimulation to feel good.
    <br>
    Most people’s levels of natural stimulation don’t reach great extremes, though it does fluctuate. Sometimes you may feel the need to seek out stimulation, while other times, you may avoid it.</p>

    <h3>Finding Out Whether You’re An Ambivert</h3>
    <p>If you think that you might be an ambivert, but aren’t certain, see how many of the following statements apply to you. If most of them apply, you’re most likely an ambivert.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>I can perform tasks alone or in a group. I don’t have much preference either way.</li>
      <li>Social settings don’t make me uncomfortable, but I tire of being around people too much.</li>
      <li>Being the center of attention is fun for me, but I don’t like it to last.</li>
      <li>Some people think I’m quiet, while others think I’m highly social.</li>
      <li>I don’t always need to be moving, but too much down time leaves me feeling bored.</li>
      <li>I can get lost in my own thoughts just as easily as I can lose myself in a conversation.</li>
      <li>Small talk doesn’t make me uncomfortable, but it does get boring.</li>
      <li>When it comes to trusting other people, sometimes I’m skeptical, and other times, I dive right in.</li>
      <li>If I spend too much time alone, I get bored, yet too much time around other people leaves me feeling drained.</li>
    </ol> 

    <h2>Values Exploration</h2>
    <p>I am a list making and structure loving idealist (with a bit of a hero-complex AKA I’m suuuuuper nosey). I have been writing things down since I was a kid so I gravitated towards my career as a business analyst. On a very high level, I would describe my job as listening to and articulating what people want and when they want it.</p>

    <h3>Where I come from</h3>
    <p>My culture may not have played a defining role in creating my identity, but my family certainly did. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and my parents realised that my lack of attention could be dangerous for a child. They taught me how to create checklists as a young child and assigning places to keep things so I would not leave them in places I could not remember. This formed a habit that follows me around to this very day! Another weakness was my lack of focus, my father introduced a system where he taught me to write down what people were saying or what was happening around me on my way home. This way I would have to pay attention to what was being said or what was happening around me because I was narrating a story. Very soon, taking notes either physically or mentally just became a habit. Unfortunately people have caught me having conversations by myself which always had me embarrassed and cringing.</p>
    
    <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
    <p>These are my strengths</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Great at planning</li>
      <li>Attention to detail</li>
      <li>quickly get to the root of an issue</li>
      <li>Completes work before begining new projects</li>
      <li>Healthy self worth</li>
      <li>Great listener</li>
      <li>Rarely upset</li>
      <li>Hyperfocus (I don’t give up * Add audio for: Rocky theme song*)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These are my Weaknesses</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cannot operate without a plan</li>
      <li>Cannot retain a single thing unless I write it down</li>
      <li>Cannot focus if stuff is out of place</li>
      <li>Am not good at "we will try this later"</li>
      <li>Cannot deal with aggression</li>
      <li>Clautrophobic</li>
      <li>Hold people to high standards</li>
      <li>Hyperfocus (don’t know when or even how to stop)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>My personality has been both a blessing and a curse. I have </p>

      <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
      <p>I have strengths that I need to play to and I am self aware of my shortcomings which I work daily to improve. Though I have not faced conflict, I have spoken up when people have aggressive stances with other people. Feedback is the most important tool when working with a team of people and I have found the best way to ensure a great synergy is through great communication.</p>

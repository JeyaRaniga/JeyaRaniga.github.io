                  Personality Exploration
              </p>
              <p>I've always found that I have never really fit into a category of intraversion or extraversion, I was never satisfied with the ENTJ personality Myers-Briggs described me as. Most of us find it difficult to choose between introversion and extraversion because the introvert/extrovert dichotomy reflects a tired and outdated view of personality. Personality traits exist along a continuum, and the vast majority of us fall somewhere in the middle.
                  <br>
                  Ambiverts have a distinct advantage over true introverts and extroverts. Because their personality doesn’t lean too heavily in either direction, they have a much easier time adjusting their approach to people based on the situation. This enables them to connect more easily, and more deeply, with a wider variety of people. Ambiverts naturally engage in a flexible pattern of talking and listening, ambiverts are likely to express sufficient assertiveness and enthusiasm to persuade and close a deal, but are more inclined to listen to customers’ interests and less vulnerable to appearing too excited or overconfident.</p>

                  How Ambiversion Works In The Brain
              </p>
              <p>How social you are is largely driven by dopamine, the brain’s feel-good hormone. We all have different levels of dopamine-fueled stimulation in the neocortex (the area of the brain that is responsible for higher mental functions such as language and conscious thought). Those who naturally have high levels of stimulation tend to be introverts—they try and avoid any extra social stimulation that might make them feel anxious or overwhelmed. Those with low levels of stimulation tend to be extroverts. Under-stimulation leaves extroverts feeling bored, so they seek social stimulation to feel good.
                  <br>
                  Most people’s levels of natural stimulation don’t reach great extremes, though it does fluctuate. Sometimes you may feel the need to seek out stimulation, while other times, you may avoid it.</p>

                  <p>If you think that you might be an ambivert, but aren’t certain, see how many of the following statements apply to you. If most of them apply, you’re most likely an ambivert.</p>

                      Values Exploration
                  </p>
                  <p>I am a list making and structure loving idealist (with a bit of a hero-complex AKA I’m suuuuuper nosey). I have been writing things down since I was a kid so I gravitated towards my career as a business analyst. On a very high level, I would describe my job as listening to and articulating what people want and when they want it.

                      Where I come from
                  </p>
                  <p>My culture may not have played a defining role in creating my identity, but my family certainly did. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and my parents realised that my lack of attention could be dangerous for children especially while crossing the street. They taught me to create checklists as a young child and assigned places to keep things so I would always be able to find them. Nows making lists is just second nature! Another weakness was my lack of focus, my father introduced a system where he taught me to write down what people were saying or what was happening around me on my way home. This way I would have to pay attention to what was being said or what was happening around me because I was narrating a story. Very soon, taking notes either physically or mentally just became a habit. I used this as a tool to pay attention when I feel my focus change. Unfortunately people have caught me having conversations by myself which always had me embarrassed and mentally cringing.</p>

                  <p class="subtitle">
                      My Strengths and Weaknesses
                  </p>
                  <p>Though planning and creating vision boards are one of my strengths, once I deviate from my plans I find it extremely difficult to go back to course. My main weakness would be not being able to be able to cope with anything that changes my otherwise meticulous schedule. 
                    <br>
                    As a strength I generally listen to people well and have good attention to detail but I do oft times get frustrated when things do not go according to plan. When this is the case I either procrastinate or become too focussed and can lose trace of other priorities.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, I was diagnosed with ADHD and with this comes hyperfocus. Hyperfocus has been a dual blessing and a curse, once I am focussed on something, I can work on it for hours to achieve the outcome I want. Sometimes, when I put my mind to something, I can be relentless to achieve my goals but this comes at the cost of having a work life balance. Incorporating excercise to my routine helps me manage stress and productivity.

                Several years ago, it was only IQ that was thought to be the only valid form of intelligence. Then fast forward to 1990s and we were introduced to the concept of emotional intelligence. We inferred that managing our emotions could potentially be even
                more important than our IQ and it has led to success in the workplace. Our understanding of the facets of intelligence was further expanded when the idea of spiritual intelligence emerged.
                <br>
                <br> But what exactly is spiritual quotient (SQ)? And why is SQ even more important in today’s era? The origin of the term spiritual intelligence and spiritual quotient is mostly attributed to Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall based on their
                pioneering book, SQ: Connecting with Our Spiritual Intelligence.

                When you think about it, we are just a speck in the universe. We are just one of the 7 billion people on Earth; just one among those 108 billion people who have ever lived. So what makes us think that our existence is more important than others?

                The world has progressed and it has offered us convenience. But can we truly say that we are a lot happier now. What exactly are the things that make us happy? We all want to be happy. But how, exactly, do you go about it?

                You might have asked yourself what is your purpose in life or who are you responsible for. Thinking about these makes us realise that we should have a vision of how we are to spend our lives. After all, we are not here forever and we should make some
                form of contribution to the next generation.

                The Difference between IQ, EQ and SQ

                    IQ – Intelligence quotient
                </p>
                IQ is an attempt to gauge human intelligence. While people have different cognitive strengths and weaknesses, psychologists have found that there is a common component called ‘general intelligence’ or ‘G’. General intelligence has been defined in various
                ways.

                    EQ – Emotional quotient
                </p>
                EQ is your way of managing your own emotion in positive ways so you could effectively deal with the vicissitudes of life. It was developed by Daniel Goleman in the mid-1990s. Studies reveal that those with EQ scores find it easier to create interpersonal
                relationships and to fit into group situations. People with higher emotional intelligence are also better at understanding their own psychological state, which can include managing stress effectively and being less likely to suffer from
                depression.

                    SQ – Spiritual quotient
                </p>
                SQ is going beyond your cognitive and emotional skills. It is acknowledging your mortality and thinking of what you could offer humanity. It is living in humility; bearing in mind that you are just a tiny compared to the vastness of the universe. A robust
                understanding of SQ motivates people to balance their work commitments, time with family and inner growth.
                <hr> When it comes to spirituality, it’s quite common to divide people into two categories; believers and non-believers but this is a false categorisation because everyone believes in ‘something’. As an atheist, I personally believe that you
                don’t need to believe in God, or read your Bible or Quran to lead a spiritually-charged life. I believe that humans are built-in with spirituality within our core. We are spiritual beings, after all.

                    Heal the World with Spirituality
                </p>

                The more we meditate with love, and work upon ourselves with compassion, the more our personal impurities, both conscious and unconscious, will gradually leave us and be replaced by the growing energies of real love and understanding.’

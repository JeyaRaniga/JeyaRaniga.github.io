    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <p>This section is all about what I plan to do to keep achieving the goals that I've set for myself on an ongoing basis.</p>
    <h2>My long term goal and or career pathway</h2>
    <p>Mhy long term goal is to develop apps that are able to learn from various stimuli and improve the way they operate. Though I want to focus on deep learning and machine learning at a later stage, I want to be able to create apps first.</p>
    <h2>Non-technical skill development at EDA</h2>
    <p>I am surprised by how much I have learnt with the programme and how much I have learnt about myself. I've never before thought about why I am the way I am or if my traits held me back somewhat. I think this journey will continue to teach me more about myself and challenge me in ways that will improve my leadership skills and working in teams.</p>
    <h2>Workload management and scheduling</h2>
    <p> to a sprint begining I create a high level visual ( usually just on scrap paper) representation of the time boxes and activities on a timeline. I use toggl (such an awesome tool!) to track timeand ensure I am on schedule. The image below is an example of what this may look like.</p>
    <img src="https://omextemplates.content.office.net/support/templates/en-us/LW00000009.png" alt="timeline"/>
    <p>I tend to adhere to schedules and my acticities on a ligh level are as follows:</p>
    <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
              <th>Activity</th>
              <th colspan="2">Time</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Wakeup, Morning Routine & Excercise</td>
              <td>06:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Breakfast & Daily Goals/ Callenges</td>
                <td>08:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Study</td>
                <td>08:30</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lunch</td>
                <td>12:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Study</td>
                <td>13:00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>Dinner Break & Relax</td>
                    <td>17:30</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Reflection & Evening Routine</td>
                <td>21:00</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

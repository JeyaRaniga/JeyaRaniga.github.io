            My long term goal is to develop apps that are able to learn from various stimuli and improve the way they operate. Though I want to focus on AI, deep learning and machine learning at a later stage, I want to be able to create apps first. I can't imagine a world without google maps or online shopping.

            Non-technical Skill Development
          </p>
          <p>
            I am surprised by how much I have learnt about myself and my own temprament. Though some people tend to reflect on their actions on a daily basis, rarely we spend the time to understand the various reasons we behave the way we do or react to stimuli the way we do. In the two sprints that I have participated, I have began a journey where I spend time trying to reflect on my own actions and understand the actual root cause of my own behaviour. I've found that learning about myself helped me think more about how I managed the relationships around me and who I surrounded myself with.

            Workload Management and Scheduling
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing I do before undertaking an event is plan what my actions will be during the the time-box. Since there is limited time available to complete activities within a sprint, I begin by creating a high level visual representation of the time boxes vs activities on a linear scale. I use toggl (such an awesome tool!) to track time and ensure I am tracking myself against the schedule. If I do end up deviating I can very easily understand what I need to do to remain on schedule. 
            <br>
            The image below is an example of what this timeline may look like. It shows activities or milestones seperated by the recommended timeboxes ( i track this in hours instead of days). The following are some rules I adhere to when I track my time.

            <p>
                As someone who's never coded before, the concept of creating a website from scratch -- script, layout and all -- can seem really intimidating. I imagined that the people who created these sites learnt at a very young age and had a special instinct about
                it all. I always thought 'I could never do that but I wish I could.' Actually, I am now learning that I can.
                <br>
                <br> Anyone can learn to code, just like anyone can learn a new language. Programming is kind of like speaking a foreign language -- perhaps that is why we call them programming languages. Each language has its own rules and commands.
                These rules tell our computer what to do. In web programming, they're telling your browsers what to do. This is where the languages <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> work together to create a website
                that is great to interact with.

                What are HTML, CSS and JavaScript?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>HTML</strong> provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. What this means that HTML takes care of all the written stuff, the images we see, the links we click
                and even the audio we hear. The content is housed in between element tags that tell us what kind of content it is. The site will not look very attractive, but all the content that we want to display will display.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>CSS</strong> is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. This means we can tell the elements that house the content what size it needs to be, what colours they need to be and where they need to go. This will make the
                site look more attractive and the content now has different colours, sizes and positions on our webpage.
                <br>
                <br> Finally, <strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to control the behavior of different elements. For example if we had a popup open after we open a certain page, JavaScript is controlling when and how it happens. JavaScript can tell the
                browser that we use to listen for certain things that we users may do and provide instructions on what to do when we do them.
                <br>
                <br> If we are building a house, HTML is the basic layout, the walls, the piping, the wiring. CSS is the colour of the walls, the windows, the type of faucets, the design of the bathroom. JavaScript is what happens when we switch on a
                light, turn on the faucet or shower or even flush a toilet. If you turn something on then it does an action.

                What are Loops in Programming?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Loops</strong> repeat actions over and over again until we are satisfied with what we are supposed to do. Each time we repeat an action we are going through the loop once or we are incrementing. Once we are satisfied that the number
                of actions has met our condition, we will stop looping. If we are brushing out hair because it is tangled, we will keep brushing out hair until we have met the condition that our hair is no longer tangled.

                What is the DOM?
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> represents the elements on a HTML page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document an object tree. That way, we can use a programming
                languages to connect to the elements on the page and change them.
                <br>
                <br> The DOM as a tree. Like a tree the DOM is made up of different elements and has a parent child relationship with these elements. By creating a tree we can perform actions to certain parts of the tree.

                Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects
            </p>
            <p>
                In JavaSript an <strong>object</strong> is a collection of things that have properties. These properties have a key-value type of relationship. The key is usually what kind of information it is and the value is whatever is assigned to
                it. For example If I was an object, then I would have a property with a key of name and a value of "Jeya".
                <br>
                <br> An <strong>array</strong> is a collection of different things such as numbers or words. Each item in an array stored against an index starting from zero.
                <br>
                <br>There are different ways of accessing data stored in an object and an array. For an object, to access information about the property, I would use the poperty name followed by a dot notation of the key Jeya.name will have the value
                of "Jeya". If I wanted to do the same for an array, I would use the name of the array and the index.

                What are functions and why do we need them?
            </p>
            <p>
                A function is an expression that performs a specific task. We can writeour own functions or use the built in functions that are available with a programming language. Functions are useful when we want to automate certain actions. Instead of looking through
                a long string of text, we can use a function to filter or change the text and return the result.

                Blocked and Frustrated!
            </p>
            <p>
                We can often become frustrated sometimes. I have spent hours on a situation that was resolved within minutes when someone else looked at the same thing. If you ever pored over a document countless number of times, yet to have someone else point out a
                mistake? Sometimes we end up seeing something that our mind wants to see than whats really there.
                <br> It was the challenge from this week's Kata <strong>"WhereAreYou?"</strong>
                <br>
                <br> I had never felt so confused in my whole life as to what a question was asking. At this point in time, my mind was still coming to terms with parameters and what they meant in the world of JavaScript. I was unsure what the question
                was asking or what I was supposed to do.

                How I Became Elegance Personified
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing I did was read the question over again and tried to break it up in pseudocode. I had to peice together the puzzle so it would come to a state where I could understand it more.
                <br>
                <br> The next thing I looked at was the tests, the inputs were strings : whereAreYou([{door: 1, hiding: "Scooby"}). This meant that the WhereAreYou? function has string input and returns a door number from that string.
                <br>I needed to filter the string for the name "Scooby" and return the door number. Once I got this far, I was able to write pseudocode and do a search on the internet. I was able to use the .filter() method and get an answer that did
                not fail the tests.
                <br>
                <br>One thing that I did not do was keep trying something to no avail, I talked to my cohort and searched online for a method that would work and worked through the issue a step at a time.
                <br> A key issue I have discovered through this weeks reflection is my lack of mindful reading. I need to pay more attention to what I am reading or listening to because in my eagerness to complete tasks, I can end up frustrated or blocked
                because I have not read the question adequately.

                I really like this style of problem-solving as I am able to talk through the process aloud and even jot down areas I would like to research.

                I roll this method into the pseudocode. I read what the pseudocode says then I repeat the line of code to see if they match.

                Reading Error Messages
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially I was extremely intimidated by this. An error message had the equivallency of the blue screen of death in my mind. I have been reading them and they are actually useful! What a surprise!

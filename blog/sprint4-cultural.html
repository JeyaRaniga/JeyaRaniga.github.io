                What is Neuroplasticity?
            </p>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity, also called brain plasticity, is the process in which your brain's neural synapses and pathways are altered as an effect of environmental, behavioral, and neural changes. When it comes to neuroplasticity, the brain is a lot like film.
                When you photograph a picture, of say, a mountain, you're exposing the film to new information. It reacts to the light, and its makeup changes in order to record the image of that mountain. In the same way, your brain's makeup changes
                when it's exposed to new information, so that it may retain that information.
                <br>
                <br> This means that we as humans never stop learning through our lifespan and the more we learn, the better adapted our brains are at retaining knowledge. The more we learn, the more dormant neurons in our brains are activated. This means
                when we practice something on a daily basis, the more likely we are to learn new things better and quicker.

                Learning with a Growth Mindset
            </p>
            <p>
                A growth mindset simply means that we are capable of growing and learning. We are capable of growing or cultivating our intelligence. Malcolm Gladwell in his book <strong>Outliers</strong> explains that truly proficiency is achieved through
                the 10,000 hour rule. In a similar respect, we are able to train our mind into learning new things like languages and in our case programming languages. The more we practice it, the better we are at it. Research has shown that spending
                15 minutes a day is sufficient to stimulate the neurons in your brain that help with learning growth.

                My Learning Strategies

            <p>
                Consistency and practice are the recurring themes in this week's learning. Keeping yourself in a state where you learn on a daily basis rather than cramming everything into a short period of time will only lead to stress. The key is to keep practicing
                everyday just like you were in a foreign country and were forced to speak the language and one day you will become as fluent speaker as if it were your native toungue. Perhaps this will be me and JavaScript? Well until then, this old dog
                will definately be practicing some new tricks.

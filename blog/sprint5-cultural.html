                What a journey it has been! I am almost afraid to part from this experience because it represents so much of the unknown when it comes to bootcamp. The core part of this process, made me think of myself as objectively as possible and I found myself questioning ideas that I once thought true about myself. I even try and describe simple things like riding a lift in the terms of a function. I extremely grateful for everything I have learnt and humbled by this experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Aside from all the learning, it was wonderful to get to know the people in my cohort and the Hihi cohort during the Foundations sprints. They have been absolutely amazing to work with and I could not have grown as much as I did if I did not have them or my facilitator around to guide me through the process.

                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't know this about myself but I find that I am quite a literal person. I do go off tangent like everyone else but one thing I require is actual answers. I don't understand abstract concepts or ideas that are not grounded. I have an issue with understanding people who are not clear and concise about what they intend. The listening and looping excercise was handy with helping me identify this together with speaking to members of my cohort, though my partner for this excercise was as literal as I was, I began to think more about some people who I felt I never understood. I now am completely self-aware of my trait and have a strategy to deal with this going forward.
                <br>
                <br>In the identities exploration excercise, I disovered that I have two distinct personalities, an introvert and an extrovert (I'm and ambivert!). The introvert liked to think about things and work through the problems in her head. The extrovert allowed me to reach out to others and discuss things when I didn't understand them.
                <br>
                <br>My final discovery was that I always trying to compare myself to other people.Core helped me identify that I placed my sense of self worth in others. I discovered in Sprint 1 that people have different ways of processing information and work at different speeds and this has nothing to do with how great your product will be. I learnt was that I would get things when I would get them and until I did, I had to keep practicing!

                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </p>
            <p>
                Programming is all about working with other people for other people. Since we all are different when there is a lack of effective communication, conflict could arise within a teams dynamic. Values, empathy and self awareness play a role in bridging the gaps in communication within groups of people.

                     What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We assume that core is relatively simple however in reality it is difficult to dig deep and articulate how we process ideas, views and situations. In particular, core learning helped me feel more at home with myself and understanding that it is all about celebrating the small successes.

                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
                The most challenging part of core learning is being honest about who you are and how you are feeling in your reflections. It is diffiult to write about yourself and have others read your thoughts and feelings especially when you are confronting or addressing attributes that you are completely unaware of. Through this process I have come to acknowledge my own areas of weakness and get over prejudices when it came to the learning process.

                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are in a high pressure situation where you have to work with other people, we should be able to learn the techniques required to deal with conflict, disruption and varring perspectives. At the same time, we need to learn how to celebrate every person's victories as a team. One of my favourite saying by Paulo Coelho states that “Happiness is something that multiplies when it is divided.”

                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                No, I don't think it is a waste of time and I do want to keep practicing programming, but not at the cost of what I have learnt as part of core. Doing the blogs and completing my reflections, made me feel heard and understood. I am here to learn about development but to learn something in a short frame of time is about having resiliance and the core learning is there to help me build it and continues to do so.
                <br>
                <br>If anyone would keep going at a problem because they felt they needed to get it as soon as they learnt about it, I would now turn around and tell them I felt the same way but now this has all changed for me. We are learning a new language, we can't do that without using a dictionary. You can't go to Japan and know how to speak Japanese on the first try, you keep referring to the dictionary and pick it up as you go. You will eventually become fluent because you pratice it everyday and perhaps one day you will not need a dictionary.

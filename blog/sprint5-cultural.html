                What a journey it has been! I am almost afraid to part from this experience because it represents so much of the unknown when it comes to bootcamp. The core part of this process, made me think of myself as objectively as possible and I found myself questioning ideas that I once thought true about myself. I can honestly say that am grateful and humbled by this experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Aside from all the learning, the best part was to get to know the people in my cohort and the Hihi cohort during the Foundations sprints. They have been absolutely amazing to work with and I could not have grown as much as I did if I did not have them or my facilitator around to guide me through the process.

                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't know this about myself but I had a fixed view about what I could or could not do. I used to feel that I need to be taught in a certain way or things have to be a certain way for me to learn better. I discovered that with a growth mindset, I could control the way I learnt and that writing about my experiences could make me think about things in a different way so I could view things with a new perspective after I had done them.
                <br>
                <br>I also disovered that I have two distinct personalities, an introvert and an extrovert (I'm and ambivert!). The introvert liked to think about things and work through the problems in her head. The extrovert allowed me to reach out to others and discuss things when I didn't understand them.
                <br>
                <br> My final discovery was that I always trying to compare myself to other people. I discovered pretty early on that people have different ways of processing information and work at different speeds. This is never an indication of what your abilities are as a programmer. The most important thing I learnt was that I would get things when I would get them and until I did, I had to keep practicing!

                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </p>
            <p>
                Programming is all about working with other people. Empathy for each other and your team is important. One of the issues I do struggle with is being able to concentrate on anything else when I have an issue at hand. I have learnt to be able to step away from issue, take care of myself, pay attention to the people around me and make sure I am paying attention to all the other aspects in my life is what leads to a win in the end.
                <br>
                <br>I acknowledge this aspect of who I am and understand that I can get more done speaking to other people than going over an issue in my own mind. I also understand that not everyone is like me and I need to explain how I work with people in order to work better as a team. There is a reason that the phrase "Two heads are better than one" was coined.

                     What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We assume that core is relatively simple however in reality it is difficult to dig deep and articulate how we process ideas, views and situations. In particular, core learning helped me feel more at home with myself and what I can do. Traditional learning environments often value performance and grades in relation to other people. The performance in Foundations was based through the creation of a shared learning environment where everyone ;earnt at their own pace and supported each other when they encountered problems.

                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
                The most challenging part of core learning is being honest about who you are and how you are feeling in your reflections. I found it difficult to share when I found things challenging and to admit that I was unable to understand something. Traditional schooling always was

Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
